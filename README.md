## Assignment
I explore two different approaches to The Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge (Zweig and Burges, 2011). The approaches investigated are a trigram model and a word similarity method using Word2Vec word embeddings. As a performance baseline, a unigram and a bigram model are used to evaluate the two selected models examined.
