# Advanced-NLP
Module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems (University of Sussex).

## Module Project
I explore two different approaches to The Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge (Zweig and Burges, 2011). The approaches investigated are a trigram model and a word similarity method using Word2Vec word embeddings. As a performance baseline, a unigram and a bigram model are used to evaluate the two selected models examined.

## LSTM Language Model
Simple language model using a Long Short Term Memory neural network. As training data, I use the same as in the module project (i.e., holmes).
